**Test Explanation:**

On My approach I have just created some simple REST api, exposing the endpoints for WorseSupplier,
BestSupplier, MedicineFinder and Country, so anywhere we can use the CRUD operations for the
Suppliers and get the merge of the suppliers with the MedicineFinder and get the list of Countries and it's alpha3code.

If I have time enough I would like to implement the Spring Security and some validations,
but I put some personal goal of doing this test in 8 hours of coding, after this, no
more coding, I have passed my own schedule in 1 hour though.
All the test took me 9 hours of coding + planning how to solve the problem.

The backend took me something like 8 hours, plus 1 hour with the Angular project to list the
results of MedicineFinder.
